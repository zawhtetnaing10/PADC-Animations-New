	<string name="lbl_paragraph">Rose O\'Neill (1874â€“1944) was an American cartoonist, illustrator, artist, and writer. Raised in rural Nebraska, she exhibited an interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies\' Home Journal, were later manufactured as bisque, composition and celluloid dolls. This chromolithograph by O\'Neill, titled When We All Believe depicts many children gathered around Santa Claus and his bag of toys, and was published in the December 2, 1903, issue of Puck.</string>
